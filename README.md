hashlib++
=========

hashlib++ is a simple and very easy to use library to create a cryptographic checksum called "hash" in C++. hashlib++ is written in plain C++ and should work with every compiler and platform. The library is released under the BSD-license and therefore free software. 

hashlib++ allows you to create a hash (for example MD5 or SHA1) with only one single method-call. So if you want to create a hash based on a file or a string quickly you might be interested. Just give it a try.
