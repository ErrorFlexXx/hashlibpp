hashlib++
=========

`hashlib++` is a simple and very easy to use library to create a cryptographic
checksum called `hash`. It is written in plain C++ and should work with every compiler and platform. 

`hashlib++` allows you to create a hash (for example `MD5` or `SHA1`) with only one single method-call. So if you want to create a hash based on a file or a string quickly you might be interested. 


By now hashlib++ supports the following functions:

	-> MD5		Message-Digest algorithm 5
	-> SHA1  	Secure Hash Algorithm 1
	-> SHA2-Family 	Secure Hash Algorithm 256, 384 and 512
	

Run amd/or modify `build.sh` to build and use hashlib++

#Just give it a try.
